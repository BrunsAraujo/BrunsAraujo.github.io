Bruno Araujo

SUMMARY
I am a resilient professional transitioning from law and insurance into software engineering, bringing with me a foundation of analytical precision, clear communication, and problem-solving persistence. My background as a paralegal and insurance adjuster sharpened my ability to break down complex information, negotiate outcomes, and document with accuracy. Skills I now apply to debugging, writing clean code, and building reliable applications.
Fluent in Portuguese and Spanish, I thrive in multicultural environments and bring a global perspective to collaborative projects.
Driven by curiosity and persistence, I am building expertise in Java, React, javaScript, and SQL with a vision to grow into a junior software developer role who bridges technical logic with human-centered design. My goal is to craft software that not only works seamlessly but also tells a story, connects people, and reflects diverse identities.
