I am excited in where I am in developping my skills as a junior Software Engineer with LaunchCode. As someone who is deeply motivated by expanding access to opportunity and using technology to create meaningful social impact, I am inspired by LaunchCode’s mission to open doors for aspiring technologists from all backgrounds. Your commitment to removing barriers and building pathways into tech aligns strongly with my own values and the kind of work I want to contribute to every day.

Before transitioning into software development, I worked as a claims adjuster and paralegal. These roles demanded exceptional attention to detail, strong communication skills, and the ability to adapt quickly to evolving technology and processes. I routinely served as a liaison between claimants, clients, attorneys, and internal teams, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and empathy in every interaction. These experiences strengthened my ability to analyze complex information, troubleshoot issues under pressure, and collaborate across departments. I believe that all these skills translate directly into building reliable, user‑focused software.

My technical background includes full‑stack development with JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS, SQL, and dynamic languages, along with experience in test‑driven development, Agile methodologies, and collaborative workflows such as pair programming and code reviews. I bring a strong sense of ownership, curiosity, and adaptability to every project, and I am committed to writing clear, maintainable, and scalable code.

What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to join a team that serves as the technological backbone of a nonprofit making a real difference. I am eager to contribute to internal tools, data‑informed strategies, and systems that support LaunchCode’s mission of expanding access to tech careers. My background in both technology and client‑focused work positions me to build solutions that are not only technically sound but also deeply aligned with the needs of the people who rely on them.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical skills, real‑world experience, and commitment to equitable access to technology can support LaunchCode’s mission. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.

Sincerely,

Bruno Araujo
