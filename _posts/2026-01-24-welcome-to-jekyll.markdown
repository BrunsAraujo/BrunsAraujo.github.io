Building this portfolio marks an important milestone in my transition into software development. After years of working in law and insurance, I discovered how much I enjoy solving problems through code, designing clean systems, and building tools that make people’s lives easier.

This site will serve as a place to document my growth as a developer. I’ll be sharing:

- Projects I’m building in Java, Spring Boot, SQL, JavaScript, and React
- Lessons learned from debugging, refactoring, and architecting clean code
- Reflections on my journey through LaunchCode and beyond
- Ideas I want to explore as I grow into backend engineering

I’m excited to continue improving, learning new technologies, and building software that is reliable, maintainable, and meaningful. Thanks for stopping by — more posts and projects are on the way.
